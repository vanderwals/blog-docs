Have you purchased your first DSLR and are excited to start capturing some amazing pictures? Make no mistake; [photography](https://creati.ai/ai-tools/categories/ai-photography/) is an art. Merely buying good cameras for photography is not enough. What to capture and how to capture it to perfection are some of the pivotal aspects of photography.

Here are some handy tips which you must utilize to improve your photography skills. Doing so will surely bring a lot of finesse and artistic touch to your photography.

### Hold the Camera Properly with Minimal Shaking

The issue that most beginners face is blurry photos. This issue is mainly caused by two reasons. First, you are not holding your camera properly, and second, your hands are shaking too much due to inappropriate posture while capturing the picture.

If you are not holding the camera properly, then this will lead to body movements and shaking. The shaking of the camera disrupts the light entering the camera sensors through the shutter. The end result appears in the form of blurry pictures.

The best approach to tackle this issue is to keep your arms closer to your body. This will minimize the shaking of the camera.

### Don’t Shy Away from Using a Tripod

There is a myth that a tripod should not be used for professional photography. That’s wrong! Tripod has nothing to do with your photography skills. If you are planning to capture a stunning picture of the sunset and want to assess the composition elements of the view properly, then using a tripod will make your job way too easy.

A tripod allows you to maintain the steady position of your camera while you take your time in adjusting the details of your picture. Once finalized, you can click the shot to perfection.

### Learn Exposure Photography Properly &#x20;

Exposure means the appearance of your picture in terms of light and dark properties. The camera’s shutter speed, aperture, and ISO settings are the pivotal details of exposure photography. You should take your time learning all the basics of exposure and then implementing it during your photography sessions.

If you don’t pay due attention to the exposure details, then it will be time-consuming and difficult for you to adjust in the post-production phase, even if you have used good cameras for photography.

### Perfect the Rule of Thirds

The rule of Thirds is one of the most popular principles in the domain of photography. Imagine your picture as a grid of 9 equal parts. This grid will have vertical and horizontal lines. According to the Rule of Thirds, your picture will have the maximum appeal if the point of interest of the subject in the picture will lie along the lines of these grids.

Modern cameras have a feature where you can turn on this grid system. If your camera does not have this feature, then you can imagine your picture in the form of a grid of 9 equal parts.

### Learn to Adjust Lighting Details

To be honest, light is everything when it comes to capturing a sleek picture. Golden hour photography helps, but you don’t always get sunsets to get good lighting and stunning views. You should learn how to capture the image of the subject in all kinds of lighting situations.

An object placed in harsh sunlight can give you a good image as well as a bad image. The final outcome primarily depends on your light adjustment skills. You should learn how using different angles in different lighting conditions can improve the quality of the picture.
