That said, what if we told you that there’s an easier and quicker way to extract text from an image?&#x20;

Well, there is one easy way that even beginners can do it flawlessly. It is to use an online image-to-text converting tool. In this post, we will provide a sort of guide that beginners can follow to convert images into text documents using an online image-to-text converter.

### Step-By-Step Guide For Converting Image To Text Documents For Beginners&#x20;

As we’ve mentioned above, the easiest way to do this is by utilizing an [online image-to-text converting tool](https://imagetotexttools.com/). This means that the first thing you’re going to have to do is find a reliable one. This is essentially what’s our first step going to be.

#### Step 1. Find A Reliable Image-To-Text Converter

There are so many tools present online that can extract text from an image and provide it in the form of a document to users. However, some of them work better and more accurately than others. This makes it important that you choose only the best one among them. To help you out in this regard, we’re mentioning some requirements below that you should consider while choosing an image-to-text converter.&#x20;

Requirements that the image-to-text converting tool should fulfill&#x20;

* The tool should utilize [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_intelligence) (AI) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for conversion. This leads to accurate results.
* It should be free to use. Sure, it can have a premium version, but it should have one for free users as well.
* The converter should support multiple languages, so you can extract text in any language you want.
* The extracted text should be downloadable in the form of a document.&#x20;
* It should support multiple image formats. i.e. JPG, JPEG, JPE, JFIF, JIF, JFI, BMP, PNG, TIFF.

These are the requirements that the tool should fulfill. Try to find one that fulfills these and we’re sure that your conversions will be accurate. Once you start looking, you’ll find many [image to text converters](https://www.imagetotext.info/) that fulfill these things. We’ve attached the image of one we found randomly below. We’ll also be using this tool for further demonstrations down the line.

#### Step 2. Provide The Tool With The Image You Want To Convert Into A Text Document

Once you’ve selected the tool, the next thing you have to do is provide it with the image that contains the text you want to convert into a document. Most converters provide multiple input options. If you’ve got one on your hands that has this feature, you can upload the [image](stock-images-vs-ai-generated-is-it-still-worth-using-stock-images-and-videos.md) or drag and drop it in the input box.&#x20;

In our case, with Imagetotext.info, we’re adding the following image to its input box.

Here’s what it should look like once you’ve provided the tool with the image.&#x20;

Now, hit the “Convert” button to start the conversion. This button might be different in your case if you choose to go with some other tool.

#### Step 3. Proofread The Output And Download It In A Document Form

After the tool has extracted the text from the given image, you should review it. Check if it’s the same as the image and nothing’s missing. Once you’re sure everything is fine, you can click on the download button and the converter will download the extracted text to your device storage in the form of a document. Here’s what the output and download button looks like in our case.&#x20;
